# SaintAdams Gaming — Jekyll Site

What this is
- A small Jekyll-powered gaming hub scaffold for GitHub Pages.
- News is managed with Jekyll posts in `_posts/` (Markdown). Posts generate URLs like `/news/your-post-title/`.
- The jekyll-feed plugin creates an RSS feed at `/feed.xml` automatically.

How to add a news post
1. Create a new file in `_posts/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`.
2. Add front matter, e.g.:
   ```
   ---
   title: "Big patch notes"
   date: 2025-12-10 12:00:00 +0000
   categories: [patch]
   excerpt: "Short summary of the patch."
   ---
   Full markdown content here...
   ```
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will build the site and your post will appear on the homepage.

Change Discord and socials
- Edit `_config.yml` and replace `discord_invite`, `twitter_handle`, `twitch_channel`, and `email` with your real links/values.
- The site templates use `{{ site.discord_invite }}` so updating `_config.yml` updates every page that references it.

Preview locally (optional — good for editing)
1. Install Ruby and Bundler if you don't have them.
2. From the repo root:
   - bundle install
   - bundle exec jekyll serve
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:4000 to preview the site locally.

Publishing on GitHub Pages
- Option A (simple): Push to a repository named `SaintAdams.github.io` on your account. GitHub Pages will serve the `main` branch automatically.
- Option B: Use any repo and enable Pages from the repository Settings (choose branch and folder).
- The feed will be at `https://<your-site>/feed.xml`.

RSS / podcast notes
- This setup generates an RSS feed for blog/news posts via jekyll-feed (feed.xml). If you want podcast-specific feeds (with iTunes tags) let me know and I can add a specialized feed template or podcast metadata.

Next steps I can do for you now
- Replace the placeholder Discord invite and social handles in `_config.yml`.
- Add example pages (Events, Community) or an archive page for News.
- Add a "featured" post section or categories/tags listing.
- Add CI to build and preview PRs (GitHub Actions) if you want automatic preview checks.

What I did and what you should do next
- I scaffolded a Jekyll site, included a sample post, and added styling and instructions for adding new posts and updating the Discord link.
- Next: pick one immediate step — do you want me to (A) replace the Discord invite and socials now (paste your links), or (B) add an example events page and News archive? Tell me which and I’ll update the files for you.
